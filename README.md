# RoadFarmer

This was a project I started on for a guy. It was some freelance work, that went up in smoke as I was not able to contact or get answers from the guy I was making it for.

The point with RoadFarmer was to make an App, where people could put themselves on the map and say we sell Strawberries, Blueberries, Apples and all such stuff. And then other people could go on the app and say they wanted to see where there are sold freshly grown Strawberries and they will pop up on the map. It was then going to be able to make a route with all the freshly grown stuff you wanted to buy, and you could make a small trip with the family.

I came so far that you could register an account and make a selling case. These cases where then shown on the map if you went to that tab, and said you wanted to see where something was sold. 

But as I said, it went a bit up in smoke because I couldn't get a hold of the "Boss".
